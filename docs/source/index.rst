Welcome to our introduction to AI!
===================================

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field brimming with potential but often shrouded in complexity, making it challenging for newcomers to find a clear starting point. This documentation is designed to address that challenge by offering a structured, step-by-step guide that empowers learners to build their own AI project, starting from zero prior knowledge.

Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~

This project aims to achieve the following:

1. **Provide a Guided Learning Path**  

2. **Centralize Resources**  

3. **Foster Practical Skills**  

4. **Encourage Self-Paced Exploration** 

5. **Inspire Creativity and Innovation**
