Can Your Problem Be Solved by AI?
=================================

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way we approach and solve complex problems. However, not all problems are suitable for AI-based solutions. Before diving into implementing an AI model, it's essential to evaluate whether your problem is a good candidate for AI. This introduction will help you make that determination by exploring key considerations such as the **Curse of Dimensionality**, **Symmetries of the Problem**, and the **Universality Theorem**.

Universality Theorem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: The **Universality Theorem** states that neural networks, given sufficient size and complexity, can approximate any continuous function to arbitrary precision. 
This makes neural networks highly versatile, but practical limitations such as training time, data availability, and computational cost must be considered.

.. note:: Can your problem be framed as finding a mapping from inputs to outputs that is continuous or piecewise continuous?
.. note:: Is a simpler algorithm or heuristic sufficient for your needs, or is the universal approximation power of AI essential?

While neural networks can theoretically solve a wide range of problems, their success depends on the quality of data, proper architecture, and efficient optimization.

Curse of Dimensionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Curse of Dimensionality** refers to the exponential growth in complexity as the number of input variables (or features) increases. AI models, especially machine learning algorithms, typically require a vast amount of data to learn effectively. 

.. note:: Does your problem involve a high-dimensional dataset? If so, do you have sufficient data to cover the possible input space?
.. note:: Are there ways to reduce the number of features through dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) or by focusing on the most relevant features?

If your data is sparse or lacks diversity across dimensions, AI may struggle to generalize and provide meaningful solutions.

Symmetries of the Problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many problems exhibit **symmetries**, meaning they remain unchanged under certain transformations (e.g., rotating an image or permuting elements). Identifying these symmetries can guide the choice of AI architectures and simplify the learning process.

.. note:: Does your problem involve inputs that have symmetrical properties (e.g., rotational or translational invariance)?

.. note:: Can these symmetries be explicitly encoded into your model, such as using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data?

Leveraging the symmetries of your problem can lead to more efficient AI models with fewer parameters and faster learning.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

To determine if your problem can be solved by AI, consider:

.. note:: **Data availability and quality**: Do you have enough labeled data to train an AI model effectively?
.. note:: **Problem structure**: Does your problem exhibit properties like symmetries that AI can exploit?
.. note:: **Complexity versus simplicity**: Would a traditional algorithm be more efficient or easier to implement for your specific problem?

If these considerations align, AI might be the right tool for the job. Otherwise, exploring alternative solutions could save time and resources.
